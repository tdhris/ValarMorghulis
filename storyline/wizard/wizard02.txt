Levina Monkstanley, Head of the Department of Mysteries, does not seem impressed with your decision to wake her up in the middle of the night. Still, she deigns to acompany you to the Space Chamber and take a look at your discovery. When the two of you get there, however, the archway is gone. For the next several months, your colleagues laugh at your overactive imagination and then everything is forgotten. You live happily to a very old age, never having set a foot on Westerosi soil.
