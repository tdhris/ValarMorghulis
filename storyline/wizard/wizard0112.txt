You walk into the city confidently, although you swear to Merlin the stench is worse than a Mountain Troll's fart. You ask several men how to get to the palace but most of them insult your old mother and ignore you. One insults your mother and tries to steal your purse. Annoyed, you decide to find your own way in this terrible place. Several hours later, as you are walking down a street that seems to be leading toward the big red citadel on top of the hills, someone grabs your waist. Before you can even make a sound, much less a move, you feel the cold kiss of a blade at your throat.
You are dead.
Valar Morghulis!
