, are a distinguished Unspeakable, working in the Space Chamber of the Department of Mysteries, where Wizards study the aspect of space.
You are conducting a risky experiment which aims to discover what will happen if a small model of a real planet is put inside a bell jar device, which you have finally been given permission to take from the Time Chamber after many months of pleading with the Head of your Department.
Excited that you finally have the chance to conduct your experiment, you pick a model of a little, unknown planet that was only discovered four years ago in a galaxy far, far away and rush through the procedure of opening the time-defying bell jar. As you put the planet into the crystal device, its sparkling light fades to a cold, grey flicker. You, not being an idiot, know that this is never a good sign but before you can do anything, the bel jar explodes in a violent storm that sends your body flying toward the stone walls of the chamber.
Once you recover your conscience, you discover a large, stone archway standing in the middle of the room - one that appalingly resembles the archway you saw in the Death Chamber that one time when your curiousity lulled your common sense to sleep and made you venture into that terribl place. No tattered black curtains cover this archway, however, and thought it you can see only innocuous snowy plains in what seems to you like the northern parts of Scotland.
You are the only one working this late at night so a question lies before you: do you step through the archway to see where it leads to or do you decide to leave the decision to the higher-ups and call your boss?
