The archway closes immediately behind you. You spend the next several months wandering through what you discover is not Northern Ireland but the northern kingdom of a continent called Westeros. You have traveled to an entirely different world! Now if you only find a way to get back to England, you will be settled for life...
One night, you make the mistake of using magic in front of a muggle villager. Next thing you know, you are being escorted to Winterfell by a dozen sworn swords of house Stark. There, you are presented before a young muggle lordling - Robb Stark.
'My men tell me you have certain… powers,' Stark begins and you can see that he clearly doubts his men. Still, he asks you to go to a place called King’s Landing - which, you infer, seems to be the capital of this kingdom - and save his lord father, Lord Eddard Stark, who has been unjustly accused of treason and taken prisoner by the young King Joffrey Baratheon and his mother, the Queen Regent.
You have a choice before you: do you agree to help Robb Stark or do you refuse to involve yourself in the feudal wars of this muggle kingdom and go on your merry way?
