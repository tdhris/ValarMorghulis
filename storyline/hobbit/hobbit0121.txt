The beautiful woman leads you to what you recognize as a brothel. There you are greated by a tiny man with a mockingbird pin who introduces himself as Lord Petyr Baelish. He asks you to abandon your quest to save Lord Stark - who is beyond salvation anyway - and asks you to deliver false information to Robb Stark's camp. Of course, he will offer you an even higher price than the one Robb Stark offered you before.
You have a choice before you - do you accept Baelish's offer or do you refuse and continue on your quest to save Lord Stark?
