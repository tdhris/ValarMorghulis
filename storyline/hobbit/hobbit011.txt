'The fuck are you?' one of the men exclaims when his eyes land on you.
Scared by the rude greeting, you almost turn your back and run. The man’s hand around his sword stops you. 'I’m a h-hobbit from the Shire,' you stutter.
'A fucking what?' the man says. 'I haven’t heard of no Shire.'
'It’s in the Westerlands, Mell,' another says. 'Right?'
You don’t know where these Westerlands place is located, but you nod anyway.
The first one shrugs. His eyes don’t leave you. 'And what is a freak from the Westerlands looking so far up in the North?' he demands.
'I was… l-lost,” you answer. Your stomach gives out a loud grumble.
The man smiles. 'Would you like to share our boiled chicken?'
'Yes!' you exclaim. 'Thank you.'
Relieved by the sudden hospitality, you come close to the fire. The man moves before you can do anything. He takes you head in his hands and pushes it into the boiling water above the fire. 
'Too bad,' you hear him shout above your screams. 'We share our chickens with no Lannister freaks here in the North.'
You shouldn’t have trusted a group of strangers, you decide in your last moments. It doesn’t matter. You’re dead.
Valar Morghulis.
