As your fingers graze the smooth surface of the ring, you feel the ground below your tremble and shiver. The light that comes from the ring intensifies until it blinds you to anything else around. You cannot even make out the familiar round door of your home…
You wake up in a strange place and spend the next two days wandering around an uninhibited, snowy place that you cannot, for the life of you, place on a map (you are no Bilbo Baggins – you have never even left the Shire before!). Freezing and half starved, relief overcomes you when you see the light of a small campfire in the distance. When you get close, you see three large, fur-clad men sitting around the fire. The smell of freshly boiled chicken makes you mouth water. You have a choice before you – do you join the strange men around the fire or do you retreat safely back where you came from?
