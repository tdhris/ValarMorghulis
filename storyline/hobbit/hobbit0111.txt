The boy takes to a fat, bald man who introduces himself as Lord Varys, Master of Whisperers. He seems to know about your abilities (because, he explains, it is his habit to know everything) and asks you to abandon your quest to save Lord Stark, who is quite safe anyway. Queen Cersei, Varys explains, would never dare to harm Lord Stark, for his son has captured Jaime Lannister, the queen's brother. Instead of wasting your talents for a man who is not in any danger, Varys asks you to go to Pentos and help a lonely girl instead.
You have a choice before you: do you continue on your quest to save Lord Stark or do you travel to Pentos where Daenerys Targaryen is waiting for you?
