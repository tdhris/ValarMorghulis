You leave Dreadford and head toward Robb Stark's camp. There you find Lord Bolton and use the Imperio curse on him. The next day he announces his intention to make his bastard son his heir. You have done your job. A few days later, while you are sleeping, Bolton's men track you and cut your throat on the orders of their Lord's sole heir. Ramsay Bolton sends his regards. You are dead. Valar Morghulis!
