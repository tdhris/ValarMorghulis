Some Names, such as the wind and time, are ever changing and thus the Namer must perceive the True Name anew each time they wish to call upon its power. You know that you won’t be able to call upon the power of time again, but you call it now anyway. You crave adventure and excitement. You feel the sweet sensation of power overcome you. The ground below you starts to tremble. Time itself folds around you. You realise that you won’t be able to hold its power once you feel yourself start losing conscience…

You spend the next several months wandering through what you discover is the northern kingdom of a continent called Westeros, which is either a place that lies beyond the four corners of civilization, or an entirely different world. You are not sure which option you find more distasteful. 
One night, you make the mistake of using sympathy in front of a group of uneducated villagers. Next thing you know, you are being escorted to a castle called Winterfell by a dozen sworn swords of house Stark. There, you are presented before a young lordling - Robb Stark.
'My men tell me you have certain… powers,' Stark begins and you can see that he clearly doubts his men. Still, he asks you to go to a place called King’s Landing - which, you infer, seems to be the capital of this kingdom - and save his lord father, Lord Eddard Stark, who has been unjustly accused of treason and taken prisoner by the young King Joffrey Baratheon and his mother, the Queen Regent.
You have a choice before you: do you agree to help Robb Stark or do you refuse to involve yourself in the feudal wars of this kingdom and go on your merry way?
