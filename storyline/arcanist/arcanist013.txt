As you are leaving Robb Stark's camp, you meet a young boy named Ramsay Snow who knows how tired you are from wandering around these country roads. He invites you to stay at his father's castle. The boy seems nice enough, so you accept. When you two arrive at his father's castle, however, Ramsay reveals that he wants a favour from you. He wants you to use your powers to make his father legalize his status as his sole son and heir. You have a choice before you - do you agree to help Ramsay, which means that you must use the darkest kind of sympathy on the boy’s father, or do you refuse?
